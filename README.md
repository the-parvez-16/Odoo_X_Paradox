# Community Connect Platform

## 🚀 Problem We're Solving
Modern neighborhoods and local communities often lack centralized, accessible digital spaces to stay informed, engage, and participate in local happenings. Whether it's a garage sale down the street, a weekend football match, or a clean-up drive — such events often go unnoticed due to fragmented or non-digital communication.

*Solution:* A location-aware community platform that empowers residents to:
- Share local events.
- Express interest in participating with minimal friction.
- Receive real-time notifications and updates.
- Strengthen neighborhood interaction and trust.
